### Overview 
Team Chronos has been approached by a medium-sized business to create a prototype organisation app for their employees; the company was interested in the project’s potential and would like to fund the development of an alpha version. As development continues, more features and better UI/UX will be implemented to achieve the long term goals of the project. 
### Motivation 
There is a market opportunity for a brilliant organisation app; most only offer a simple calendar and to-do list as their final product; this will be Chronos’ Alpha. While the original vision is highly functional, polished and complex, the alpha must be simple, effective and functional. 
Therefore, we must create a solid foundation for a fully-featured app, and the code must be written efficiently and utilise minimal machine resources whilst also being extensible. Much thought must be put into the development to simplify the expansion and polishing of the functionality and user experience.
